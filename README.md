Summary of software and hardware engineering projects completed at UGA and independently.

Welcome! This is a public overview of some of my key engineering projects. Due to academic policy, source code is private, but Iâ€™ve included detailed descriptions, tools used, and my contributions.

1. Weather App

**Tech Stack:** Java, REST API, MacOS Terminal  
**Description:**  
Developed a Java application that detects the user's location using their IP address and retrieves real-time weather data (temperature, wind speed) using a public REST API. Supported custom IP-based searches.

**Highlights:**
- Integrated external APIs using Java networking
- Designed CLI interface for usability
- Built for scalability and reuse


2. Audio-Tracking Car â€“ ECSE 2920

**Tech Stack:** Python, Raspberry Pi 4, Multisim, Breadboards  
**Description:**  
Collaborated on a hardware-software system where a car detects C6 and C8 audio frequencies and navigates based on signal recognition. Reached **Checkpoint Aâ€“**, validating functionality in real-world testing.

**My Role:**
- Developed Python code for signal detection logic (Code was created with several other members since this was a group project).
- Built and tested circuits with Raspberry Pi and breadboards
- Contributed to technical documentation and testing protocol


3. Morse Code LED Display (Extra Credit)

**Tech Stack:** Python, GPIO, Breadboards  
**Description:**  
Created a GPIO-driven LED display system that flashes Morse code based on user pushbutton input. Used Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to control timing and color-coded LED messages.

**My Role:**
- Wrote Python script to map button presses to Morse sequences
- Wired 3-color LED system on breadboard
- Debugged timing synchronization for message clarity
